# About

Part of speech tagged text from the Tibetan in Digital Communication ([larkpie.net/tibetancorpus](http://larkpie.net/tibetancorpus/)).

These trained texts include all three of the projects groups of corpora:

> At present, the corpus consists of three distinct collections. First, there is the Classical corpus.

> Second, there is the Saint Petersburg corpus, consisting of texts assembled and tagged by Pavel Grokhovski from Saint-Petersburg State University. We are re-tagging these texts in order to make them consistent with our scheme.

> Third, there is the Berlin corpus, kindly provided to us by Michael Balk. This corpus comprises the entire Tibetan catalogue of the Berlin State Library. It came to us fully segmented, but not tagged. We are now tagging the corpus after having converted it from Extended Wylie to Unicode.

> Together, these three collections constitute the "Complete corpus".
